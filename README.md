# Vigilant Engine

Vigilant Engine is the framework on which all ESP-based nodes of the **Starstreak** project are built.  
It provides the fundamental building blocks for connected, remotely maintainable devices, including
reliable OTA updates, flexible network modes, and peripheral support.

## Core Features

- **OTA (Over-The-Air updates)**
  - Firmware updates via HTTP/Web UI
  - Designed for safe, recoverable updates on ESP targets

- **Network Modes**
  - `AP` – Device creates its own access point
  - `STA` – Device connects to an existing Wi-Fi network
  - `APSTA` – Dual mode (access point + station)

- **Webserver**
  - Serves configuration & status pages
  - Handles OTA firmware upload
  - Endpoint structure designed to be extendable per project

- **Debugging**
  - Wireless debugging over the network (e.g. TCP terminal)
  - Centralized logging API for modules
  - Optional verbose / debug builds

## Peripherals

Vigilant Engine includes drivers / integration for:

- **WS2812B** – Addressable RGB LEDs (status indication, effects)
- **TCAN4550-Q1** – SPI CAN controller
- **TCAN332** – CAN transceiver

These peripherals are wrapped in a common abstraction layer so they can be reused across all Starstreak nodes.
